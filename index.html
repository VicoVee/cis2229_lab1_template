    <h1> Welcome to CIS2229 Lab 1 </h1>
    <p>Please refer to the lab manual to get started! There are a few requirements
        you must follow to receive all points. To begin, let's start creating your first page: <strong>About Me</strong>
    </p>
    <!-- DELETE THE LINES ABOVE THIS COMMENT BEFORE SUBMITTING -->

    <!-- Start of About Me Section  -->
    <div id="profileCard">
        <!-- Step 1: Add the contents required for your About Me page. The first requirement has been partially done for you -->
        <h2>My name? I have none!</h2>

        <!-- Step 2: Add your TU email here -->
        <div id="email_info">
            <h3><a href="mailto:tuq23078@temple.edu">Send me some mail at mail.mail@hotmail.com</a></h3>
        </div>

        <!-- Step 3: Add 3 things about you: Fun Fact, Major/Minors and Where you are from -->
        <!-- Note: An unordered list has been created for you below with the Major already populated -->
        <ul id="fun_facts">
            <li> <a target="_blank"
                    href="https://www.temple.edu/academics/degree-programs/information-science-and-technology-major-st-ist-bs">
                    Information Science and Technology major
                </a>
            </li>

            <!-- Add the next list item tag to add another fact about yourself -->
             <li></li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Here is a set of links that are connected to images. You can change this as a part of the extra credit-->
        <!-- A link is wrapped around an image tag, which allows the user to click on the image 
                and open an external site -->
        <div id="image_links">
            <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/uHGShqcAHlQ?si=S4emKSiV4zqkw3ub">
                <img src="./images/silentprincess.png" />
            </a>
        </div>

        <!-- Step 4: Think of a username and password to use later in the lab. Create hints for them here -->
        <div class="secret_hints">
        </div>

    </div>
    <!-- End of About Me Section -->


    <!-- Step 5: Create two files: wildcard.html and secret.html -->
    <!-- You can simply copy your index file or create a new page from scratch.
        If you opt to create a page from scratch, type "!" and press enter to get an HTML template
    -->

    <!-- Step 6: Create a navigation bar -->
    <!-- Below I have already added a nav tag for you. The nav tag is special to a regular ole' div,
         in which it is used to define the webpage structure clearly for search engines as well as marking
         the navigation bar properly for accessibility. Feel free to move this navigation section anywhere 
         you want in the code.
