#Welcome to CIS2229 First Lab!
For the next two weeks, you will be creating a simple website and hosting it on Temple's server.
The first part of the lab is to create the website! This project here is a template for you to use.
Feel free to use other tools to help you create your site.

**Please refer to the lab manual in the Canvas page for the rubric and requirements**
