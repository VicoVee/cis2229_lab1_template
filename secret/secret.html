		<h2>Welcome</h2>
		<p>Here lies all the tips and tricks to succeed in CIS2229</p>
		<div><img src="../images/tinycat.jpg"></div>
		

		<h3>Quizzes</h3>
		<p>Generally, both sections will take 3 quizzes throughout the semester.
			Before each quiz, Claudia will do a Kahoot with the whole class. Pay close attention to the Kahoots.
			If you need to go back to review the questions again, remember that Claudia records every lecture on Zoom.
		</p>

		<h3>Exams</h3>
		<p>
			There are 2 exams, one is the mid-term and the final exam. Again, Claudia will do a Kahoot for both of these
			exams.Ensure that you understand the questions and answers from the Kahoot. In both exams, there will be 2-4 open-ended questions.
			Pay close attention to the lecture prior to the exam, as Claudia will go over the open-ended questions. You can then prepare 
			your answers ahead of time.
			<br><br>
			For the final exam, there is likely a fill-in the blank. Claudia will provide a word bank with single-use words.
			You do not have to memorize all vocabulary words from Claudia's study guides, but there are some words that
			are more important to recognize.
			These words are used often in the lectures. Also pay attention to the applications used in the labs. The names
			will appear in the exams.

			<br><br>
			You are allows a 5x7 index card for the final exam. I suggest writing about the last unit (Networking) as it is covered more quickly than other units.
